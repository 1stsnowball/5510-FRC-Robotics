//autonomousInit() - Initialization code for autonomous mode
// should go here. Will be called each time the robot enters
// autonomous mode.
// disabledInit() - Initialization code for disabled mode should
// go here. This function will be called one time when the
// robot first enters disabled mode.
// robotInit() - Robot-wide initialization code should go here.
// It will be called exactly 1 time.
// teleopInit() - Initialization code for teleop mode should go here.
// Will be called each time the robot enters teleop mode.

// autonomousPeriodic() - Periodic code for autonomous mode should
// go here. Will be called periodically at a regular rate while
// the robot is in autonomous mode.
// disabledPeriodic() - Periodic code for disabled mode should go here.
// Will be called periodically at a regular rate while the robot
// is in disabled mode.
// teleopPeriodic() - Periodic code for teleop mode should go here.
// Will be called periodically at a regular rate while the robot
// is in teleop mode.

// autonomousContinuous() - Continuous code for autonomous mode should
// go here. Will be called repeatedly as frequently as possible
// while the robot is in autonomous mode.
// disabledContinuous() - Continuous code for disabled mode should go
// here. Will be called repeatedly as frequently as possible while
// the robot is in disabled mode.
// teleopContinuous() - Continuous code for teleop mode should go here.
